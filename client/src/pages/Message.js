        <h2>Executive President's Message</h2>
        <p>Dear Students,</p>
        <p>
          MIT World Peace University, the Flagship University of MAEER’s MIT
          Group of Institutions, is carrying forward the legacy of four decades
          of Educational Excellence. It has always laid great emphasis on the
          development of human spirit and character by imparting ‘Universal
          Value Based Higher Education’. This is reflected in the number of
          lives we continue to touch upon through various on-campus Initiatives
          – both of core academics and other allied endeavors to ensure Holistic
          Development. Today, our Alumni are spread across the world, and many
          of them are either holding key Leadership roles or are making
          invaluable contributions to society by running successful
          Enterprises/Social NGOs. Do you know what is the common thread of
          Success each of them shares? It’s the ‘Foundation of Healthy
          Mind-Body-Spirit and Character’ that we strive to cultivate here
          through various activities centered on ‘Technology, Research,
          Partnership, and Social Innovation’.

          MIT-WPU Sports Summit is one such unique ‘National Level
          Inter-Engineering Sports Meet Pune’ that has been conducted since
          September 2004. Year-on-Year, we have witnessed an increasing number
          of Engineering graduates from across the Nation participating
          enthusiastically in the Sports Summit. This has resulted in helping
          individual students get ‘Sporting Recognition’ on a national platform,
          thus opening the doorways for better opportunities for them in their
          respective Sporting fields. We have also Instituted ‘Krida Puraskar
          Awards’ that recognize Successful and Inspiring Sports Personalities
          who have displayed consistent performance on National and
          International Level, displaying both Physical and Mental Tenacity.
        </p>
        <p>
          I always tell my beloved Students who are the Present and the Future
          of our great nation that - ‘You have the SKILLS, We provide the
          PLATFORM. Let’s See How FAR can YOU GO?’
        </p>
